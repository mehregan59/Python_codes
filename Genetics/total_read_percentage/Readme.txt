IF using windows, I recommend Install anaconda navigator then run the code from there for example from cmd of selected anaconda environment 
This python function accepts mapping files from BBmap software (see test files). Then it creates csv named (Read_percentage_table.csv) report contains ID, total read, read 1, percentage of read 1 and read 2 and percentage of read 2. 
Make sure use full path of folder containing mapping file like this 
D: \test\
The full command to run this python file is like this 
python total_read_percentage.py D:\test\
